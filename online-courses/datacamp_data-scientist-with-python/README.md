A Data Scientist combines statistical and machine learning techniques with Python programming to analyze and interpret complex data. [URL](https://www.datacamp.com/tracks/data-scientist-with-python "DataCamp's - Career Track - Data Scientist with Python")

Thanks to [wblakecannon](https://github.com/wblakecannon/DataCamp) who I referenced the data used in the Career Track courses that was not easily attainable through DataCamp, as well as a similar directory naming convention. This sped up copy/pasting my code solutions into local notebooks for later reference provided in this repository. My approach differed from wblakecannon's by placing all code solutions from a single course into a single jupyter notebook vs. their approach of saving individual .py files. This meant that I was able to run the notebooks displaying output onto my github compared to just code.
